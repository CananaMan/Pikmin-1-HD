OK, so i've optimized the pikmin and bulborb scripts (which gave me 100 fps more than before lmfao)
and im going to optimize the others. the trick is to use an IEnumerator to wait .2f seconds (0.2 seconds)
in any update function. this reduces the amount of calls to the processor or whatever it needs to make
and therefore reduces the amount of computational power required. Speeding the game up!
