# Performance:

Updated to version 2018.3.2f1, 
converted javascript code to c#,
updated postprocessing to 2.0,
fine tuned occlusion culling,
and made proper light maps.

# General / New:

Made shadow animations for the impact site,
started Pikmin testing again,
added basic disbanding,
finally removed third party assets and Neo's original project 'Pikmine',
removed a bunch of unnecessary stuff,
started doing the "P i k m i n" map,
made basic fileselect with support for going straight into game when loading,
optimized the .umbracache files, (occlusion culling) and removed about 5000 of them.

# Fine Tuning:

Changed some normal map strengths so it looks better,
made the camera be closer and further away where necessary,
increased the speed of whistle expansion,
changed Pikmin collision detection type and AI detection,
altered the postprocessing stack to use only Ambient Occlusion, Color Grading and Depth of field.

# Fixes:

Whistle collision errors on anything but the map.
