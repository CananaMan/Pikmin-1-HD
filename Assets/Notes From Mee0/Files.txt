**Notes about plugPiki.dll**
It loads pikmin 1 in developer/debug mode.
Text starts to become readable at offset 00470010.
Interestingly, at offset 00471410. It mentions that its has memorycard support.
This has not been spoken of in conversations about plugPiki.dll thus far in Hocotate hacker.
It even references formatting the memory card. It has references to making new MAPSELECT, SETUP,
BANNER, CARDSELECT, COURSECLEAR, EXIT and CREDITS.
At offset 00472120 there is a reference to pikis/happas/leaf.mod for seemingly no reason
keep in mind that near this are references to the pikmin .MODs (which are for preloading
for the level startup)


**Notes about sysBootup.exe**
When you load sysBootup and it throws that error, its because the developers didnt
actually program it properly. They called for things when everything wasnt properly 
initialised which means that it threw an error.
Plugins are detected on program start, this can be confirmed by the command
`+plugins  (folder where plugins are)` and the fact that if you move a plugin
out of the plugins folder, it doesnt load.
There are also dlls we dont know about/don't have access to.
In sysBootup.exe at offset 00015010 you can see the different parameters, which are:
```+client, +direct +plugins and +output.```
Heres the text unedited if anyone cares.
`OpenGL / Dolphin System. A top level window does not exist,the application will now close.
Warning! config.ini, +client done Creating atxDirectRouter +direct +plugins +output 
got cmdParams [%d] : %s plugins %s: sysBootup Basedir = %s DUIClearWin`
Also in sysBootup.exe. At the final 4 offsets (0001B010 to 0001B040) we can see that it is
a debug build of a developers program, as stated here:
`C:\Development\DolphinPiki\sysBootup\Debug\sysBootup.pdb`
It also seems to be a log of everything, which, if you open atxServer then it seems to 
transfer its log-like capabillities over.
